## Project made for Distributed Systems discipline.

The project consists of a CRUD communication between different servers and clients, logging everything that happens in a file.
Also there is a recovery system for the database in case an error occur or a server crashes.

We provided two types of communication with the server, one by using simple datasocket and other using GRPC, which is a terrific techonology.
